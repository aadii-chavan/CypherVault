# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Secure Vault Sentry application to address vulnerabilities and implement best practices.

## üîê Encryption and Key Management

1. **Strengthened PBKDF2 Parameters**
   - Increased iteration count from 1,000 to 310,000 (OWASP recommended)
   - Standardized on 256-bit key length
   - Implemented proper salting for all key derivation

2. **Upgraded Encryption Algorithms**
   - Switched from CBC to GCM mode in AES encryption
   - Added authenticated encryption to prevent tampering
   - Improved IV generation and management

3. **Secure Key Storage**
   - Implemented in-memory storage for sensitive keys instead of localStorage
   - Added key expiration and automatic clearing
   - Created encrypted session-based storage for persistence

## üîí Authentication and Session Management

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implemented client-side login attempt tracking
   - Added automatic account lockout after multiple failed attempts
   - Created Firestore rules for rate limiting critical operations

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Standardized on generic error messages to prevent user enumeration
   - Added detailed server-side logging while keeping client messages vague
   - Implemented better error sanitization

3. **WebAuthn Implementation**
   - Removed plaintext key storage from Firestore
   - Implemented a more secure key encryption approach
   - Added timestamp tracking for key rotation policies

4. **Session Management**
   - Added activity-based auto-locking
   - Implemented session validation in Firestore rules
   - Created more robust session timeout handling

## üìù Audit Logging

1. **Tamper-Evident Logs**
   - Implemented hash chaining for log integrity verification
   - Added sequence IDs to detect missing entries
   - Created dual storage (local and server) for reliability

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Moved from localStorage to encrypted session storage
   - Added in-memory cache with timeouts
   - Implemented redundant logging for critical events

3. **Privacy Improvements**
   - Added sanitization of sensitive data in logs
   - Improved metadata collection for better context
   - Implemented log rotation and size limits

## üõ°Ô∏è XSS and Input Validation

1. **Input Sanitization**
   - Created comprehensive HTML sanitization
   - Implemented object sanitization for nested properties
   - Added output encoding functions

2. **Input Validation**
   - Created strict validation for emails, URLs, and usernames
   - Implemented password strength validation
   - Added parameter validation framework

3. **Output Encoding**
   - Added helper functions for safely setting text content
   - Implemented HTML entity encoding for dynamic content
   - Created truncation functions to prevent overflow attacks

## üöß Infrastructure and Access Control

1. **Firestore Rules**
   - Added proper authentication checks for all operations
   - Implemented fine-grained access control
   - Added validation for data integrity
   - Created operation-specific rate limiting

2. **Secure Data Architecture**
   - Isolated sensitive collections
   - Added read-only audit logs
   - Implemented principle of least privilege throughout

3. **API Security**
   - Added proxy for third-party services like HIBP
   - Implemented k-anonymity for password checks
   - Created fallback mechanisms for API failures

## üîç Other Security Improvements

1. **Stealth Mode**
   - Improved stealth mode to use secure storage
   - Enhanced panic mode to clear all sensitive data
   - Added better UI obfuscation

2. **Password Management**
   - Improved password strength estimation
   - Enhanced breach checking with fallbacks
   - Implemented secure password storage and verification

3. **Memory Management**
   - Added secure memory wiping
   - Implemented automatic clearing of sensitive data
   - Created timeout-based data expiration

## Future Recommendations

- Implement server-side rate limiting through Firebase Functions
- Add IP-based anomaly detection for login attempts
- Implement FIDO2/WebAuthn for passwordless authentication
- Consider adding a server-side proxy for all API calls
- Implement CSP headers for better XSS protection
- Add automated security testing to the CI/CD pipeline
